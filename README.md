# Line-Following-Robot
Designed and developed a Line Following Robot using Arduino, implementing C language for programming, line detection, and motor control, resulting in an efficient and precise autonomous line following functionality.
Incorporated an IR sensor in the project, leveraging the principle of light to enable precise line detection and
navigation by the robot.
